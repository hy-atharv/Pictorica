**Pictorica - Where Every Picture Tells a Story** is a groundbreaking app that allows anyone, with just a picture, a rough story idea, and perhaps an author's name, to craft creative stories like a seasoned author. Users can publish their stories or keep them private on their shelf. They can browse through a vast library of stories in various genres, read them, or immerse themselves by listening, and can even chat with the main characters of the stories. Stories can be liked or saved for reading them later.

## Structure of App Codebase

## Firebase Authentication

In the [**Firebase**](https://github.com/hy-atharv/Pictorica/tree/main/Firebase) Folder,
You can find 3 files:

1. [**firebaseConfig.js**](https://github.com/hy-atharv/Pictorica/blob/main/Firebase/firebaseConfig.js)

`firebaseConfig` initializes your Firebase App and its instance is stored in `app` which is exported for use in other code files.

With `app` Firestore is initialized with a Firestore setting:

`experimentalAutoDetectLongPolling:true`

This setting configures the SDK's underlying transport (WebChannel) to automatically detect if long-polling should be used. This is very similar to `experimentalForceLongPolling`, but only uses long-polling if required.

Firestore's instance is stored in `db` which is exported for use in other code files.

Authentication is initialized by `app` with the `persistence` property as:

`persistence: getReactNativePersistence(AsyncStorage)`

With the `AsyncStorage` and `getReactNativePersistence`, app's authentication state is persisted.

2. [**firebaseRegister.js**](https://github.com/hy-atharv/Pictorica/blob/main/Firebase/firebaseRegister.js)

With the Firestore instance `db` the asynchronous function `createUser(email, password, username)` creates a user with email and password and updates the user's profile by setting the `displayName` property's value to `username`

`await sendEmailVerification(user)` sends an email to the user, when user verifies his email by clicking on the link received in mail, in firestore, a document is created in the collection **users** with the id as `user.uid` and initializes a Map:

`{
  username: username,
  followers:0,
  aboutMe:'',
  pfpURL:'',
}`

Any other sign up error is caught in the `catch` block and prompts the user.
